delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.
