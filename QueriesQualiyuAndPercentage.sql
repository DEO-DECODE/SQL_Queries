Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.


Create table If Not Exists Queries (query_name varchar(30), result varchar(50), position int, rating int)
Truncate table Queries
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'Golden Retriever', '1', '5')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'German Shepherd', '2', '5')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'Mule', '200', '1')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Shirazi', '5', '2')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Siamese', '3', '3')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Sphynx', '7', '4')

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select query_name, round(avg(rating/position),2) as quality, round(sum(if(rating<3, 1, 0))/ count(query_name)*100,2) as poor_query_percentage from Queries group by query_name;
